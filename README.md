# Stock Tracking

## What does this app do ?

This application makes it possible to compare stocks with each other (thanks to data normalization) as well as their evolution over time 
It is also equipped with charts used in trading, to buy at the right time. I made it for all investors wishing to follow their stocks, or stocks they plan to buy.

## How to use it ?

Unzip the Stock-Tracking folder, inside you will find a lot of files. For the proper functioning of the app, do not delete or move any. Look for the executable file with the same name as the folder (the one with an icon), and create a shortcut (for convenience). Put the shortcut where you want , then click on it. A terminal and a graphical interface will open. Follow the instructions of the graphical interface (Type the tickers that interest you, separated by a single space), then click on the Start button. After a few seconds and depending on your internet connection, a dashboard will appear. On this dashboard you will see different interactive data visualizations. Note that the SP500 index is still present, even if you didn't type it into the GUI. On the first figure, you can click on the legend to choose the stock(s) you want to compare. You can also change the time horizon from the drop-down menu on the left. By scrolling down the page you will find a dropdown menu, in order to choose the stock, then a small table indicating the variations in the value of the stock in percentages, as well as three technical figures (RSI, trading volume, bollinger bands). All these figures are interactive and update according to what you have chosen in the drop-down menu.

## What to do in case of trouble ?

In case of operating problem after opening the program, the first thing to check is the validity of the tickers you have entered. If you have any doubts about a ticker or the stock market you belong to, type in google 'Company_name ticker yahoo finance' and you should find it without problem. Make sure you have only put one space between the tickers and have a good internet connection. If the problem persists do not hesitate to let me know by email 'lucasfernandez2308@gmail.com' and I will be happy to answer you.
I created this application in order to follow my stocks, and to find the right moment to strengthen a position, after realizing that it was not easy to find a free and exhaustive comparator. If you have a suggestion for improvement, do not hesitate to let me know by email 'lucasfernandez2308@gmail.com'. Thank you for reading this document to the end, and I wish you success in your investments.
